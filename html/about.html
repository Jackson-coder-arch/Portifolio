        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a young man a go getter and never settle for less. I always get myself around positive energy, i carry not a faint heart hence allows me to keeping moving not matter the challenges around. My greatest aspiration is to be a problem solver at the capacity am in. One of the greatest lessons i have learnt along the way is to see opportunity in every crisises and embrace change. I am a born-again believer during church events i do sound engineering, i do play the bass guitar. Am a student at Moringa school pursuing software development.Here are afew interesting things about me;
            <ul>
                <li>I am highly perceptive and have razor sharp intuition. This does not mean that I know everything, and it does not mean that I am never wrong. But my instincts about people, events and situations are usually spot-on.</li>
                <li>Carrys a positive energy with me.</li>
                <li>I love to learn new things, and I embrace my inner nerd.</li>

                <li>I love riding</li>
                <li>I am a <em>highly sensitive person (HSP)</em> . Figuring this out was life-changing.</li>
                <li>I used to be a conflict-avoider, but no more. I hated confrontation for the longest time, but I don’t do that anymore. I still love harmony in my relationships, but I choose to deal with issues directly and promptly so they don’t fester and get worse.</li>
